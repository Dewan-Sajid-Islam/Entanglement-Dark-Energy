# Entanglement-Dark-Energy
Complete implementation of the groundbreaking Entanglement Dark Energy cosmological model, where dark energy emerges from quantum-gravitational entanglement entropy. Includes MCMC analysis with Planck+Pantheon+BAO+SH0ES data, resolves Hubble tension (H₀=72.1±0.9), and provides production-ready code with full reproducibility.
